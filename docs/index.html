        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Dolap is a native Android application that helps users organize their wardrobe,
            build outfits, track outfit usage, and gain insights into their clothing habits.
            The app works fully offline using a local SQLite database. 
        </p>

        <h2>App Concept</h2>

        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
            Many people own a large number of clothes but struggle to decide what to wear,
            remember good outfit combinations, or identify unused items. Dolap addresses
            this problem by connecting wardrobe storage with outfit planning and usage tracking.
        </p>

        <h3>Use Case</h3>
        <p>
            Dolap is a lifestyle and productivity app that supports personal wardrobe organization and daily outfit planning.

        <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype & User Flow</h2>
        <p>
            A high-fidelity prototype was designed in Figma to visualize the final application.
            The main navigation is divided into three sections: Wardrobe (Clothes), Outfits, and Insights.
