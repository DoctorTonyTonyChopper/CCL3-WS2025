          This section presents the results of the usability test conducted to evaluate the system’s usability and overall user experience.
          The analysis includes participant demographics, task performance, task-level usability (SEQ), overall usability (SUS),
          user experience quality (UEQ-S) and qualitative feedback.

          The usability test was conducted with six participants. Participants had a mean age of 26 years, with ages ranging from 20 to 36,
          representing a user group aligned with the app’s intended target audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gender distribution was evenly balanced, with three male and three female participants (50% / 50%), ensuring that results were not biased
          toward a single gender group.

        <p>
          All participants successfully completed all eight tasks, resulting in a 100% task completion rate. No task failures or critical usability
          breakdowns were observed during the test. This indicates that users were able to understand task goals and navigate the interface effectively
          without external assistance.

      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Task-level usability was measured using the Single Ease Question (SEQ) after each task. Mean SEQ scores across the eight tasks ranged from
          6.50 to 7.00, demonstrating consistently high perceived ease of use. No task scored below 6.5, suggesting that none of the evaluated tasks
          caused notable difficulty for users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall mean SEQ score was 6.69, which indicates that participants found the tasks very easy to complete overall. These results suggest
          that the interaction flows, labels, and system feedback successfully supported task execution and that users rarely needed to pause, reconsider,
          or recover from errors.

        </p>
        <p>
          According to established SUS interpretation guidelines, this score falls well within the excellent usability range. The consistently high scores

          <li><strong>Pragmatic Quality</strong> achieved a mean score of 2.17, rated as <strong>Excellent</strong>, placing the system among the top 10% of benchmarked products. This reflects strong perceptions of efficiency, clarity, and usefulness.</li>
          <li><strong>Hedonic Quality</strong> achieved a mean score of 1.54, rated as <strong>Good</strong>, with 75% of benchmark results scoring lower. This indicates a positive emotional experience, though slightly less pronounced than the pragmatic aspects.</li>

          Qualitative feedback was collected through post-test questions to complement the quantitative results and provide deeper insight into user
          perceptions and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, participants consistently described the app as easy or very easy to use, reporting little to no difficulty during interaction.
          Several participants noted that navigation felt intuitive once they became familiar with the interface, supporting the high SEQ and SUS scores
          observed across participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants reported a positive overall experience, frequently describing the app as intuitive, smooth, and enjoyable. The app’s usefulness
          for outfit planning was mentioned multiple times, particularly the ability to track when outfits were last worn, which was seen as highly relevant
          to users’ everyday needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most participants reported no confusion or frustration while completing tasks. When issues were mentioned, they were localized rather than
          systemic. Recurring problems included difficulty noticing the “worn today” feature, limited search functionality for outfits compared to
          clothing items, and minor expectation mismatches after deleting items. These issues were described as minor and did not significantly affect the
          overall experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most tasks were perceived as easy due to the app’s clear layout and straightforward interface. Adding and editing items were frequently mentioned
          as the easiest tasks, while searching for outfits and locating the “worn today” functionality was perceived as less intuitive, pointing primarily
          to discoverability issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants generally reported that they knew what to do next while completing tasks. Occasional moments of confusion were brief and easily
          resolved, indicating effective system feedback and recoverability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suggested improvements focused mainly on enhancing the visibility and feedback of the “worn today” feature, adding shortcuts for frequent actions,
          improving outfit search, and refining edit and delete interactions. Notably, some participants indicated that they would not change anything,
          reinforcing the overall positive perception of the app.

          In addition to user testing, the app design was reviewed by our Mobile User Interface (MUID) lecturer based on a screen recording of the
          application. He provided expert feedback focusing on visual hierarchy, spacing, touch target sizes, and interaction clarity. All suggested
          improvements were incorporated into the design.

          Key refinements included increasing font sizes for secondary text, adjusting paddings to improve visual balance, and ensuring consistent border
          radiuses across buttons. Touch accessibility was improved by enlarging tap areas for tags and frequently used controls, in line with mobile
          usability guidelines.

          Form interactions were refined by using full-width input fields and dropdowns and by strengthening the visual emphasis of primary actions such as
          the “Save” button. Edit and delete actions were visually rebalanced to prioritize non-destructive actions and reduce accidental errors.

          Navigation and information presentation were improved through clearer visual cues, consistent use of icons, and alternative visual representations
          for ratings, occasions, and seasons. Thumbnails were added to the Insights screen to improve scannability.

          Additionally, one usability test participant was our User Experience Evaluation (UEE) lecturer, who also provided oral feedback during the test
          session. This feedback was also incorporated, including limiting the number of “most worn outfits” displayed, setting the outfit overview as the
          landing page, and replacing text-based edit and delete buttons with icons for greater consistency.

          Across all evaluated measures, the system demonstrated very high usability and user experience quality. The combination of a 100% task completion
          rate, high task-level usability (SEQ), an excellent overall usability score (SUS), excellent UEQ-S benchmark results, and consistently positive
          qualitative feedback shows that users were able to complete tasks easily, efficiently, and with a high level of satisfaction. These findings are
          further strengthened by expert feedback from UI and UX lecturers, which was fully incorporated into the design through targeted refinements.
          While the small sample size limits generalizability, the convergence of user data and expert review provides strong evidence of a well-designed,
          user-centered system.
