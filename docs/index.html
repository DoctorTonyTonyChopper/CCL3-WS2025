        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Dolap is a native Android application that helps users organize their wardrobe,
            build outfits, track outfit usage, and gain insights into their clothing habits.
            The app works fully offline using a local SQLite database. 
        </p>

        <h2>App Concept</h2>

        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
            Many people own a large number of clothes but struggle to decide what to wear,
            remember good outfit combinations, or identify unused items. Dolap addresses
            this problem by connecting wardrobe storage with outfit planning and usage tracking.
        </p>

        <h3>Use Case</h3>
        <p>
            Dolap is a lifestyle and productivity app that supports personal wardrobe organization and daily outfit planning.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Students and young professionals (18–35)</li>

            <li>Users interested in making better use of their existing clothes</li>

        <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype & User Flow</h2>
        <p>
            A high-fidelity prototype was designed in Figma to visualize the final application.
            The main navigation is divided into three sections: Wardrobe, Outfits, and Insights.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add a clothing item from the Wardrobe screen</li>
            <li>Create an outfit by selecting items from the wardrobe</li>
            <li>Log when an outfit is worn</li>
            <li>Explore Insights to understand wardrobe usage</li>
        </ol>

        <tr>
            <td>Visibility of system status</td>
            <td>
                The app usually gives clear feedback (e.g. snack bars for delete/undo,
                wear counts updating). Some actions, like saving edits, could give clearer
                confirmation feedback.

            <td>
                Concepts like Outfits, Tags, and Wear history match how people think
                about their wardrobe. The wording is simple and easy to understand.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>User control &amp; freedom</td>
            <td>
                Users can undo deletions, giving them control over mistakes.
                Removing delete actions from grid items reduced the risk of accidental actions.

        <tr>
            <td>Recognition rather than recall</td>
            <td>
                Images, thumbnails, chips, and previews help users recognize items
                instead of remembering details.

        </tr>

            <td>Aesthetic &amp; minimalist design</td>
            <td>
                The app is colourful but still structured.
                Some screens were simplified to reduce clutter and improve scannability.

        <p><strong>Hypothesis (H2):</strong> Participants will understand the required steps and follow the intended workflow without major confusion.</p>
        <p><strong>Variables:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IV:</strong> Task workflow (e.g., add clothing → save → find item → edit)</li>
            <li><strong>DV:</strong> Task completion rate (%), observation notes, SEQ score per task</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>TQ3: Search Function Effectiveness</h4>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can users effectively find clothing items and outfits using the search functionality?</p>
        <p><strong>Hypothesis (H3):</strong> Participants will find specific clothing items and outfits within a reasonable time and with few errors.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>IV:</strong> Use of the Dolap app</li>
            <li><strong>DV:</strong> SUS score, UEQ-S scores (Pragmatic Quality, Hedonic Quality), qualitative feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methods for Data Collection</h3>

        <h4>Setup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Lab-based (moderated usability test)</li>
            <li>6–8 participants</li>
            <li>Environment: quiet room with a laptop and an Android phone provided by the team</li>
            <li>Audio recording for think-aloud protocol</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Quantitative Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task performance metrics:</strong> time on task (seconds), task completion rate (%), error rate (errors per task)</li>
            <li><strong>Standardized questionnaires:</strong> SEQ after each task; SUS at the end; UEQ-S before the post-test interview</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            SEQ and SUS help measure ease of use and usability, while UEQ-S captures how users feel about the app overall
            (e.g., enjoyable, attractive, pleasant).
        </p>

        <h4>Qualitative Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Think-aloud protocol</li>
            <li>Observation notes (hesitation, confusion, unexpected behaviour)</li>
            <li>Semi-structured post-test interview (likes/dislikes, perceived problems, improvement suggestions, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Planned Tasks</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a new clothing item with photo, category, and tags</li>
            <li>Search for the created item by filtering for it</li>
            <li>Edit an existing clothing item (change the colour, season, and tag)</li>
            <li>Delete an existing clothing item</li>
            <li>Create a new outfit and add clothes to it</li>
            <li>Find the outfit using the search function and open it</li>
            <li>Mark the outfit as “worn today”</li>
            <li>View insights and interpret the available data (most worn clothes, never worn clothes, least worn clothes, not worn in 90 days)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Study Materials and Tools</h3>
        <h4>Documents</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Moderator script (intro + study instructions)</li>
            <li>Informed consent</li>
            <li>Participant background questionnaire (age, gender, etc.)</li>
            <li>Task sheet for moderators (scenario, time, success, help needed, notes)</li>
