                                <p>The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the structure of the SQLite database used in our Dolap application. The database consists of core entities including Clothes, Outfits, Tags, and Saved_Filters, each identified by a primary key.
                                    Many-to-many relationships are implemented using junction tables, such as Outfit_Clothes for linking outfits and clothing items, Clothing_Tags for categorizing clothes with tags, and Saved_Filter_Tags for associating saved filters with tags. 
                                    A one-to-many relationship exists between Outfits and Outfit_Wear, which stores outfit wear history. This design reduces redundancy and supports efficient data organization.

                            In this project, I worked together with my colleague on the design, development, and evaluation of the mobile application Dolap as part of the course Creative Code Lab 3. Before the course started, we collaboratively developed the app concept and created a high-fidelity Figma prototype, which we presented on the first day of CCL3. During this phase, we defined the goal of the app, its core features, and the target user group, which provided a clear foundation for the further development process.

During the implementation phase, we used my previous mobile coding course project as a starting point. While this initial version only supported basic clothing management and filtering, we significantly expanded the app together throughout the semester. My main coding contributions included implementing the outfit builder with clothing selection and image previews, establishing the many-to-many relationship between outfits and clothing items, adding outfit wear history with date management, and developing the Insights screen with wear-based analytics. In addition, I worked on improving UI and UX consistency across the app, including image handling, layout structure, navigation, and visual clarity.

Alongside the development process, my colleague and I prepared and conducted the usability study. We jointly created all required documentation, including the moderator script, informed consent form, participant background questionnaire, task sheets for moderators and participants, SEQ and SUS questionnaires, UEQ-S, observer notes, and the post-test interview guide. We also developed a usability test plan, conducted a heuristic evaluation based on Nielsen’s heuristics, formulated hypotheses, and defined the data to be collected. In total, we conducted six usability tests, during which I acted as the active interviewer in three sessions.

After the testing phase, I was mainly responsible for evaluating and analysing the collected data. This included processing questionnaire results, summarizing findings, and creating graphs for the usability documentation. Through this project, I learned how important it is to combine technical implementation with continuous user evaluation. I gained deeper insights into Android development, database design, and Jetpack Compose, while also strengthening my skills in usability testing and data analysis. Overall, the project helped me better understand the complete lifecycle of an app, from early concept development to testing and refinement, and highlighted the importance of collaboration and iterative improvement.

                        <p><em>For this project, I worked together with my teammate on the mobile app Dolap as part of the Creative Code Lab. The app was based on my teammate’s existing mobile coding course project, which already included basic clothing management features. During Creative Code Lab, we continued working on this foundation and focused on extending the functionality, improving usability, and refining the overall design based on user and expert feedback.

My main role in the project was implementing new features and translating design and usability feedback into concrete changes in the app. Early on, I worked on improving the clothing flow by adding a splash screen, predefined tags, size options, camera and gallery support, and more consistent delete actions. I also implemented a complete tagging system for clothing items, including tag storage, tag selection in add and edit screens, visual tag chips, and SQL-based filtering in the search. This made browsing and filtering clothes much more practical and user-friendly.

Another major part of my contribution was building the outfits feature. I implemented the outfits tab with full create, edit, and delete functionality, added the necessary repositories and ViewModels, and integrated the new screens into the existing navigation without breaking the original wardrobe flow. This allowed users to group clothing items into outfits and laid the foundation for outfit-based insights.

We planned and conducted the usability tests together. While my teammate mainly focused on analysing and evaluating the collected data, I was responsible for implementing the feedback from both the usability tests and the professor. Based on this feedback, I revised several screens by adjusting font sizes, improving spacing and padding, increasing touch target sizes, and refining button hierarchy, for example by making edit actions more prominent than delete actions. I also worked on improving overall visual consistency and clarity across the app.

In the Outfits and Insights sections, I implemented additional design improvements to make information easier to scan and understand. This included adding icons and thumbnails, reworking how ratings are displayed, limiting and structuring lists such as “most worn” items, and making key actions easier to access. Overall, this short but intensive project helped me learn how to iteratively improve an existing app by directly translating user and expert feedback into UI and code changes. It strengthened my skills in Jetpack Compose, UI/UX implementation, and working with a larger, pre-existing codebase under time pressure.

        <p>
          Sarah and Mahmut each did their own heuristic evaluation, then discussed each other’s points and made this final version.
          Overall, the heuristic evaluation indicates that Dolap is easy to use and well structured. It uses familiar concepts, consistent layouts,
          and clear visuals that help users understand and navigate the app. Most actions give good feedback and error prevention is handled well,
          though some confirmations and error messages could be clearer. Only minor usability issues were found.

          Qualitative feedback was collected through post-test questions to complement the quantitative results and provide deeper insight into user
          perceptions and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, participants consistently described the app as easy or very easy to use, reporting little to no difficulty during interaction.
          Several participants noted that navigation felt intuitive once they became familiar with the interface, supporting the high SEQ and SUS scores
          observed across participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants reported a positive overall experience, frequently describing the app as intuitive, smooth, and enjoyable. The app’s usefulness
          for outfit planning was mentioned multiple times, particularly the ability to track when outfits were last worn, which was seen as highly relevant
          to users’ everyday needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most participants reported no confusion or frustration while completing tasks. When issues were mentioned, they were localized rather than
          systemic. Recurring problems included difficulty noticing the “worn today” feature, limited search functionality for outfits compared to
          clothing items, and minor expectation mismatches after deleting items. These issues were described as minor and did not significantly affect the
          overall experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most tasks were perceived as easy due to the app’s clear layout and straightforward interface. Adding and editing items were frequently mentioned
          as the easiest tasks, while searching for outfits and locating the “worn today” functionality was perceived as less intuitive, pointing primarily
          to discoverability issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants generally reported that they knew what to do next while completing tasks. Occasional moments of confusion were brief and easily
          resolved, indicating effective system feedback and recoverability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suggested improvements focused mainly on enhancing the visibility and feedback of the “worn today” feature, adding shortcuts for frequent actions,
          improving outfit search, and refining edit and delete interactions. Notably, some participants indicated that they would not change anything,
          reinforcing the overall positive perception of the app.

      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          In addition to user testing, the app design was reviewed by our Mobile User Interface (MUID) lecturer based on a screen recording of the
          application. He provided expert feedback focusing on visual hierarchy, spacing, touch target sizes, and interaction clarity. All suggested
          improvements were incorporated into the design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key refinements included increasing font sizes for secondary text, adjusting paddings to improve visual balance, and ensuring consistent border
          radiuses across buttons. Touch accessibility was improved by enlarging tap areas for tags and frequently used controls, in line with mobile
          usability guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Form interactions were refined by using full-width input fields and dropdowns and by strengthening the visual emphasis of primary actions such as
          the “Save” button. Edit and delete actions were visually rebalanced to prioritize non-destructive actions and reduce accidental errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigation and information presentation were improved through clearer visual cues, consistent use of icons, and alternative visual representations
          for ratings, occasions, and seasons. Thumbnails were added to the Insights screen to improve scannability.

          Additionally, one usability test participant was our User Experience Evaluation (UEE) lecturer, who also provided oral feedback during the test
          session. This feedback was also incorporated, including limiting the number of “most worn outfits” displayed, setting the outfit overview as the
          landing page, and replacing text-based edit and delete buttons with icons for greater consistency.

          Across all evaluated measures, the system demonstrated very high usability and user experience quality. The combination of a 100% task completion
          rate, high task-level usability (SEQ), an excellent overall usability score (SUS), excellent UEQ-S benchmark results, and consistently positive
          qualitative feedback shows that users were able to complete tasks easily, efficiently, and with a high level of satisfaction. These findings are
          further strengthened by expert feedback from UI and UX lecturers, which was fully incorporated into the design through targeted refinements.
          While the small sample size limits generalizability, the convergence of user data and expert review provides strong evidence of a well-designed,
          user-centered system.
